## Description

This application is aim fro a note taker that can be used to keep yourself orginized. The basic function is to create a title for the note and a description as to what is the contents of the note. this project helped me understand how to deploy to heroku and using enviormental variables to deploy a page with a server attached. The extra credit for this project was to be able to delete the notes created but i was unable to implement that at the moment. i will come back to this project to further the project and correct this mistake.
